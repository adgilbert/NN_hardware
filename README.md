# VLSI implementation of a neural network

This repository contains the documentation for our class project in the VLSI Design class at the University of Utah in Fall of 2015. This project was put together by Andy Gilbert, Calli Clark, and Tom Becnel. 

The project consisted of designing and implementing a neural network in hardware. This was our first foray into implementing neural networks in hardware and we took rough inspiration from the IBM TrueNorth chip. The project was implemented over the course of ~7 weeks with the first ~3 weeks consisting of designing and building a custom standard cell library and the next ~4 weeks consisting of creating the full design using our standard cell library, testing, and performing final layout and wiring for the packaging. We used the Cadence design environment. Additional details can be found in the documents and images in this directory.
